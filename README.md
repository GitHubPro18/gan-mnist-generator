#  GAN for MNIST Digits Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate MNIST-style handwritten digits using PyTorch Lightning. The code includes a custom `GAN` class and a data module `MNISTDataModule` for managing the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- **Generator**: Produces realistic MNIST-style images from latent vectors.
- **Discriminator**: Differentiates between real and fake images.
- **Adversarial Loss**: Uses binary cross-entropy to train both models.
- **PyTorch Lightning Integration**: Simplifies training loops, logging, and hardware acceleration.
- **MNIST Data Module**: Manages data loading and preprocessing for training, validation, and testing.

## Setup and Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- PyTorch Lightning
- Torchvision
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pytorch-lightning 
```

## Code Overview

### 1. `MNISTDataModule`
This class handles the MNIST dataset, including downloading, transforming, and creating DataLoader objects for training, validation, and testing.

- Normalizes MNIST images to mean=0.1307 and std=0.3081.
- Splits the training set into training (55,000 samples) and validation (5,000 samples).

### 2. `Generator`
The generator model consists of:
- Fully connected layers to project latent vectors.
- Transposed convolutional layers for upscaling to 28x28 images.
- Tanh activation for output scaling between -1 and 1.

### 3. `Discriminator`
The discriminator model includes:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Fully connected layers for binary classification.
- Sigmoid activation for final outputs.

### 4. `GAN` Class
This PyTorch Lightning module encapsulates:
- The generator and discriminator.
- Adversarial training logic.
- Custom optimizers for both networks.

Training steps:
1. Train the generator to produce realistic images.
2. Train the discriminator to distinguish between real and fake images.

### 5. Training Script
To train the model, use:
```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(
    accelerator="auto",
    devices=1,
    max_epochs=10,
)
trainer.fit(model, dm)
```

## Logging
- Generated images during training and validation are logged using TensorBoard.


## Results
- Training logs and generated images are saved in the `lightning_logs` directory.
- Example images generated by the model during training can be visualized in TensorBoard.
